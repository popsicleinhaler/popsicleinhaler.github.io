<h1>Hello Sar Sar</h1>
<h3>Look! We're hosted with GitHub Pages!</h>
<p>I’m scared that the truth, the objective fact of the matter is closer to how you’re seeing it and that the way you see the world with your exactness and formalness and carefulness is better able to approximate the true answer of what it takes to keep an everlasting relationship than my chaotic, romantic, free view of the world. Unfortunately, these same pillars that you stand on for arriving at your conclusions are the same barriers that keep us from feeling close.</p>
<p>I'm unable to unentangle my emotions from what I think of us... I'm disarmed of my rationality,I doubt and I'm confused </p>
